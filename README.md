# Atomtown - BO2 MOD

## About

Atomtown is a custom sort of "expanded" version of nuketown. It adds easter eggs, perk machines, and some touchups to the nuketown we all know and love. It's a mod for plutonium

## Installation

To install atomtown, press the green "Code" button, then press "Download as zip". Open the zip, and find compiled/t6 inside the zip. Drag both gametype_setup and the zm_nuked folder into your plutonium mods folder. Then, youre done.

DO NOT CHANGE FILE OR FOLDER NAMES. LEAVE EVERYTHING THE SAME

## Setup

Before you start playing, make sure to check the config.gsc file inside the zm_nuked folder and set the variables to your liking. There is an uncompiled version inside this repo too, and atomtown is free for use.

Enjoy!
